# Crowdfunding-contract
A decentralized crowdfunding is a new way of raising funds on blockchain  technology. It’s a distributed database that’s secure and tamper-proof and  that eliminates the need of trusted third party to verify transaction.
The use case of this smart contract is to allow for a secure and transparent voting system. The smart contract can be used to prevent voter fraud and ensure that the election results are accurate.

Here are some of the benefits of using a smart contract for voting:

-> It is more secure than traditional voting systems.
-> It is more transparent.
-> It is more efficient.
-> It is more accessible.
